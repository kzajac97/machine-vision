# Interpolation

This class contains exercises using interpolation for functions and images. Each notebook covers a different example, which are:

* `conv-transpose.ipynb` - auxiliary class using convolution transpose to upsample images
* `function-interpolation.ipynb` - interpolation of a function using convolution and splines
* `image-interpolation.ipynb` - interpolation of an image using convolution
* `scaling-and-rotation.ipynb` - scaling and rotation of an image using convolutions
