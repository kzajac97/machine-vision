# Machine Vision

This repository contains notebooks and source code for laboratories of two courses: *Machine
Learning and Machine Vision* and *Digtal Signals and Images* on Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.

The course covers low-level image processing methods and some photography
related problems (for example rolling shutter). Notebooks marked as entrypoint
for each class should all contain links to resources useful for given class.
